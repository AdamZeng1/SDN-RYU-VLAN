# SDN-RYU-VLAN
Code repository of the OpenFlow based Software Defined Networking application built on the RYU controller. The RYU controller is based on OpenFlow 1.3 and interacts with switches running OpenvSwitch 1.2. For simplicity, it is assumed that the topology and the required VLAN configuration (for each switch) is known priory and therefore no topology discovery is carried out in this application.The RYU application is tested for 3 types of networks:A VLAN-Only linear (2 Switch-4 Host) topology ,A VLAN-only topology containing multiple switches and trunk lines and lastly a hybrid network with VLAN aware and Non-VLAN aware switches. The application has been developed such that it is scalable with higher number of nodes and compatible with any kind of VLAN configuration.
